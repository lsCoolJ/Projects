# Projects
This repository contains personal projects that I have been working on and decided to put on Github.

## Snake
This snake game took a few hours and isn't 100% complete.

## proEuler.c
This c file is the code that I have written to solve the problems posted on Project Euler. Not every question from Project Euler has been solved. Every problem in this c file is commented out for the next problem to be run and compiled. Uncomment specific answers to problems in order to run them one at a time.
